# Memory Matching Game Project
### William Chow

For the term project I have decided to create a
**memory matching game**. The game consists of multiple
down facing cards where a user can then choose two of them
and see if they match. The front side of the cards will
have images. If the images of the cards match, then they will
be discarded, otherwise they will be turned back over.
The ***objective*** of the game is to match 
all the cards until there are none remaining.

The reason I was interested in designing a memory based game is
because it helps develop memorization skills while
being fun to play. The goal of this project was
to design a game that can be played by *anyone* as it is
not too difficult.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to choose any two cards
- As a user, I want to be able to select the mode 
  difficulty (number of cards)
- As a user, I want to be able to quit the game anytime
- As a user, I want to be able to save the state of the cards in the game
- As a user, I want to be able to load and resume the game where I left off
